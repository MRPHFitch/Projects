# Projects
This is a collection of course projects that I have worked on. 

# Animation Mapper  
The animation mapper is a GUI implementation of of trip log csv data file. The points are plotted on a GPS map and an animated tracker will highlight and show the path of the trip. Utilizes an executable JAR file. Beware of grumpy cat.  

# DOS  
This is a python implementation of a basic graphing program that works through the stages of utilizing threading, then gRPC to create a Client-Server implementation. From there it scales up to a Client->Broker->Server, Multi-Client->Server, and finally a Client->Multi-Server. Nothing too fancy, just working with gRPC.  

# SetOps
A C++ program to read a file of Sets, then perform set operations on those sets after initializing them into a map.

# nTickets
An R implementation of calculating how many tickets an airline needs to sell in order to not overbook a flight but still fill the plane up.  

# Google Homepage
My first ever coding project. I was learning HTML and attempted to create a front end only recreation of the Google Homepage. No working links or search bar. Just the appearance and layout.
